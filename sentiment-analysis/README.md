# Sentiment Analysis Toy Project

This toy project aims to build a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The project will cover data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using popular machine learning or deep learning frameworks.

## Project Steps

### 1. Dataset Selection and Preparation

- Choose a suitable dataset for sentiment analysis. You can use publicly available datasets like IMDb Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, or any other dataset that includes text and sentiment labels.

- Preprocess the dataset to clean and normalize the text data. This may involve steps such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and handling punctuation or emojis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Tokenize the text data to convert sentences into a sequence of tokens or words. This can be done using libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy.

- Convert the tokenized text into numerical representations that can be fed into a machine learning model. Common techniques include using word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or creating bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations.

### 3. Model Architecture Design

- Choose a suitable model architecture for sentiment analysis. For traditional machine learning, you can use classifiers like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests. For deep learning, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTM, or transformer models like BERT can be used.

- Define the model architecture using the chosen framework (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch). Specify the layers, activation functions, and other parameters of the model.

### 4. Model Training

- Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. You can use functions like `train_test_split` from the scikit-learn library to perform the split.

- Train the sentiment analysis model using the training data. Set the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Use an appropriate optimizer and loss function for training.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to measure its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's classification performance.

- Generate a confusion matrix to get a detailed analysis of the model's predictions for each sentiment class.

## Additional Tips

- Experiment with different data preprocessing techniques, such as using different tokenization methods, handling negations or contractions, or using stemming or lemmatization.

- Try different model architectures and hyperparameter configurations to improve the sentiment analysis model's performance.

- Consider using techniques like cross-validation or grid search for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

- Document your project thoroughly, including explanations of each step, code comments, and insights gained from the results. This documentation will be useful for your own reference and for sharing your work with others.

Remember to consult the official documentation of the libraries and frameworks you use (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for specific implementation details and additional resources. Good luck with your Sentiment Analysis toy project!
