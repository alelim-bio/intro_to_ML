# Image Classification Toy Project

This toy project aims to build an image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. The project will cover data loading, preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation using popular deep learning frameworks.

## Project Steps

### 1. Dataset Selection and Preparation

- Choose a suitable image dataset for classification. You can use publicly available datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or download datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. You can use functions like `train_test_split` from the scikit-learn library to perform the split.

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Load the image dataset using a suitable library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These libraries provide tools for handling image datasets conveniently.

- Preprocess the image data to prepare it for training. Common preprocessing steps include resizing the images to a fixed size, normalizing pixel values, and converting the images to tensors.

### 3. Model Architecture Design

- Choose a suitable CNN architecture for image classification, such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception. These architectures have been proven effective for image recognition tasks.

- Define the model architecture using the deep learning framework of your choice (TensorFlow or PyTorch). You can either use pre-trained models and fine-tune them for your specific task or build a custom model from scratch.

### 4. Model Training

- Split the training set further into training and validation sets. This allows you to monitor the model's performance during training and make adjustments if necessary. A common split is 70% for training and 30% for validation.

- Train the model using the training data. Set the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Use an optimizer like Adam or SGD to update the model's weights during training.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its performance on unseen data. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's classification performance.

- Generate a classification report or confusion matrix to get a detailed analysis of the model's performance for each class.

- Visualize some test images along with their predicted labels to qualitatively assess the model's performance.

## Additional Tips

- Experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance.

- Keep track of your experiments by logging the hyperparameters, training progress, and evaluation metrics. This will help you compare different models and identify the best-performing one.

- Document your project thoroughly, including explanations of each step, code comments, and insights gained from the results. This documentation will be useful for your own reference and for sharing your work with others.

Remember to consult the official documentation of the deep learning framework you choose (TensorFlow or PyTorch) for specific implementation details and additional resources. Good luck with your Image Classification toy project!
