## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of toy projects that cover various machine learning topics. Each project comes with a detailed explanation and step-by-step instructions to guide you through the implementation process. The goal is to provide you with a practical understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Toy Projects

1. [DNA Sequence Classification](./dna-sequence-classification) - Classify DNA sequences into different categories based on their properties or functions. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation using a Random Forest classifier.

2. [Image Classification](./image-classification) - Build an image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. This project covers data loading, preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation using popular deep learning frameworks.

3. [Sentiment Analysis](./sentiment-analysis) - Perform sentiment analysis on text data using natural language processing techniques. This project explores various text preprocessing methods, feature extraction with bag-of-words or word embeddings, and model training using algorithms like Naive Bayes or LSTM.

Feel free to explore each project folder for the source code, datasets (if applicable), and accompanying documentation.

## Notes

The [notes](./notes) directory contains additional resources and explanations to help you grasp the underlying concepts in machine learning. These notes cover fundamental topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, evaluation metrics, model selection, and more. They provide a theoretical foundation to complement the practical implementation in the toy projects.
